# Concurrent programming in C++


"try_lock" is a valuable tool in multithreaded programming because it provides a way to handle situations where a lock may not be available. For example, if a critical section of code is protected by a mutex, and several threads try to access that section simultaneously, only one of them will be able to lock the mutex and execute the code. The other threads will be blocked until the lock becomes available.

However, if a thread uses "try_lock" to attempt to acquire the lock, it will immediately return a Boolean value indicating whether the lock was acquired or not. If the lock was not acquired, the thread can continue to do something else, without waiting for the lock to become available. This can be useful in situations where the thread is not dependent on the results of the critical section, and can continue to do other work in the meantime.
In C++, "try_lock" is typically implemented using the try_lock member function of a mutex class, such as std::mutex or std::timed_mutex.
It's important to note that "try_lock" is not a blocking operation, so it does not prevent other threads from executing. It simply provides a way for a thread to determine whether a lock is available or not.
A practical use case for "try_lock" is when a thread wants to access a shared resource but it's not critical for the thread to do so immediately. For example, consider a program where multiple threads are trying to increment a counter. The counter is a shared resource that needs to be protected so that multiple threads do not access it simultaneously and cause race conditions.

In this scenario, a thread can use "try_lock" to attempt to lock the mutex that protects the counter. If the lock is acquired, the thread can increment the counter and release the lock. However, if the lock is not acquired, the thread can choose to do something else, rather than waiting for the lock to become available.
